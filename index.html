    If you are a fan of the movie
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)"
        style="text-decoration: none; color: limegreen">Avatar</a></strong>, you should definitely add
    <strong>Zhangjiajie National Forest Park</strong> to your bucket list!
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center">
    <strong>Zhangjiajie National Forest</strong> is located in the
    <strong>Hunan province of China</strong>. It is known for its incredible
    natural beauty, unique geological formations, and breathtaking landscapes
    resembling the movie Avatar sets. The park covers an area of over 3,000
    square kilometres and is home to over 3,000 unique rock formations,
    towering sandstone pillars, and deep ravines that have been carved out by
    millions of years of erosion. These formations are so unique that they
    have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The main attraction of
    the park is the towering sandstone pillars that rise up from the forest
    floor, often shrouded in mist and clouds. Locals call these pillars the
    <strong>"Hallelujah Mountains"</strong> due to their resemblance to the
    floating mountains in the movie Avatar.
